# IDEA MCP Priority

Use IDEA MCP before generic project tools for work in the current JetBrains workspace. This skill governs discovery, routing, and verification; repository editing rules still apply.

## Reading Order

Read only the reference needed for the task. This skill is self-contained: its `references/` directory supplies the operational guidance for every supported IDEA tool family.

| Intent | Read first |
| --- | --- |
| Direct tools, router mode, prefixes, parameters | `references/invocation.md` |
| Files, search, symbols, call hierarchy, project state | `references/navigation-and-analysis.md` |
| Manual edits, refactors, inspections, build and Git | `references/change-and-verification.md` |
| Run configurations, tests and debugging | `references/run-and-debug.md` |
| Database, Inspection-KTS/PSI and walkthroughs | `references/specialist-tools.md` |

When individual IDEA tools are directly exposed, their live descriptions and schemas are authoritative for exact field names, types, defaults, and result shapes. In router-only mode, use the relevant reference page's documented calling pattern and runtime validation feedback.

## Core Rules

1. Detect the currently exposed IDEA interface before choosing a tool. Never hard-code a prefix such as `mcp__idea__` or `IDEA___`.
2. Prefer direct IDEA tools when individual tools and schemas are exposed. Otherwise locate the universal `execute_tool` router and follow `references/invocation.md`.
3. Pass a known `projectPath` on every direct IDEA call, or as the router's **outer** argument. Do not rely on `--projectPath` inside a router command.
4. Use IDEA search, **source reading**, symbol, module, inspection, run-configuration and database capabilities before shell alternatives when they cover the workspace task. Read project source with `read_file` even for a small snippet; do not use shell merely because the user has selected text or because the first slice attempt is awkward.
5. Treat project files, attached dependency sources, decompiled classes, and archive entries as IDEA-readable source: run `search_symbol` with external lookup enabled when needed, then pass the returned `*.jar!\\...` path unchanged to `read_file`. Do not unpack JARs, use `javap`, or read workspace source with shell while IDEA can resolve it.
6. Use your own tools for manual edits and file creation; user and repository rules take priority. Do **not** use `create_new_file`.
7. Use `rename_refactoring` for symbol renames; never perform them as blind text replacements.
8. After each individual source-file patch, immediately inspect that file with `get_file_problems` before editing another file. Do not defer IDE problem reads until after a batch of edits or a build; build the affected scope afterward when cross-file compilation validation is appropriate.
9. For runtime debugging, activate the official `ij-debugger` skill. This skill routes to IDEA MCP but does not duplicate debugger procedure.

## Source-reading default

Use `read_file` as the first and continued path for source content. For a normal-sized file, a complete IDEA read followed by local in-memory extraction is valid when only chat-provided byte offsets are known. For an ordinary snippet, use the router's verified start-line offset, inspect the returned boundaries, and locally crop any excess content the router returns. Read `references/navigation-and-analysis.md` before handling selected-text byte offsets or a failed slice attempt.

## Fallback

Use a non-IDE fallback only when the target is outside the workspace, no suitable IDEA capability exists, or IDEA MCP has failed and retrying is not a reasonable next step. State that limitation rather than guessing tool parameters or results.
